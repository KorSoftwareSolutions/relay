# Relay

**Relay** is a powerful deferred linking and referral attribution library designed for React Native and Expo applications. It enables seamless attribution tracking by matching users across app installations using device fingerprinting.

## What is Deferred Linking?

Deferred linking allows you to attribute a user's actions before app installation to their behavior after installation. This is crucial for:

- **Referral Programs**: Track who referred a new user
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Attribute app installs to specific campaigns
- **Deep Linking**: Redirect users to specific content after installation
- **User Attribution**: Match pre-install and post-install user sessions

## How Relay Works

Relay uses a two-step process to match users across sessions:

### 1. Capture Phase (Pre-Install)

When a user clicks a referral link or visits your landing page:

```typescript
// User clicks referral link with returnTo parameter
// e.g., yourapp.com/relay/capture?returnTo=https://example.com/invite/abc123

await relayExpoClient.capture(returnToUrl);
```

Relay captures a unique device fingerprint including:
- Device manufacturer and model
- Operating system details
- Screen dimensions and pixel ratio
- Timezone and language settings
- IP address
- Clipboard content (optional)

### 2. Process Phase (Post-Install)

When the user opens your app after installation:

```typescript
const result = await relayExpoClient.process();

if (result.url) {
  // Match found! Redirect user to the deferred link
  router.push(result.url);
}
```

Relay generates a new fingerprint and matches it against stored fingerprints to retrieve the original link.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Accurate Attribution**: Uses multi-factor device fingerprinting
- 📱 **Expo & React Native**: Built specifically for mobile apps
- 🔒 **Privacy-Focused**: No third-party tracking services required
- ⚙️ **Flexible Storage**: Bring your own database (file-based, SQL, NoSQL)
- 🪝 **Customizable Hooks**: React to match events with custom logic
- 📊 **Built-in Analytics**: Track fingerprints and link performance

## Quick Start

Get started with Relay in minutes:

```bash
pnpm add @korsolutions/relay
```

See the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Use Cases

### Referral Programs

Track who referred each new user and reward them accordingly:

```typescript
const result = await relayExpoClient.process();
if (result.url) {
  const referrerId = extractReferrerFromUrl(result.url);
  await rewardReferrer(referrerId);
}
```

### Marketing Attribution

Attribute app installs to specific marketing campaigns:

```typescript
// Capture with campaign URL
await relayExpoClient.capture('https://yourapp.com/campaign/summer-sale');

// Process and track conversion
const result = await relayExpoClient.process();
if (result.url?.includes('summer-sale')) {
  trackConversion('summer-sale');
}
```

### Content Deep Linking

Direct new users to specific content after installation:

```typescript
const result = await relayExpoClient.process();
if (result.url) {
  // Navigate to the specific content
  router.push(result.url);
}
```

## Architecture

Relay consists of two main components:

1. **Client SDK** (`RelayExpoClient`): Runs in your Expo/React Native app
2. **Server SDK** (`createRelayServer`): Handles API requests and data storage

Both components work together to provide seamless attribution tracking.
